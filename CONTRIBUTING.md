# Ask a question
We monitor the GitHub issues section specifically for bugs.  However we will also reply to questions asked using Github issues.

# File a bug (code or documentation)
Please open an issue on GitHub; we'll address it as fast as possible.  The more thorough the issue description, the easier to expedite triage and issue a bug fix.

# Report a vulnerability
Vulnerabilities in dependent libraries are actively monitored and triaged.  Vulnerabilities in library code can be reported to the [Microsoft Security Reponse Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc?rtc=1) (MSRC).

# Contribute documentation
For markdown files, we accept documentation pull requests submitted against the `master` branch on existing documents.

# Contribute code
Pull requests should be submitted against the `master` branch.  All pull requests must pass an automated build process ensuring compliance with lint rules, test coverage, etc.  Following approval, releases are automatically generated and published to [npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org).  The library enforces [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) rules.  Release automation tools mandate the use of [Angular Commit Messages](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) per [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).  Pull requests will be rejected if they do not use these conventions.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.
If you feel like your contribution is going to be a major effort, please give us a heads-up to ensure your plans and ours are in sync :) Just open an issue on github and tag it "enhancement" or "feature request"
